# Advent of Code 2022: Quinn's attempt

This is a folder of Quinn's solutions (or attempts at solutions) for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## How to use

Most of the solutions are written in Ruby and take the name of the input file as an arg (or you can supply the input file on stdin).

E.g.

```console
$ ./01-calorie-counting/calories.rb input/01.txt
```

The directory `input/` is gitignored - feel free to put your input files in there.
